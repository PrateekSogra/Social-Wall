# Getting Started with Create React App

Here I have created a Social Media Wall Application with features to post something on your feed, comment, delete. 
This app also has a chatting option where you can send your messages to friends.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run this sscript to install the dependencies and packages for the project.\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
